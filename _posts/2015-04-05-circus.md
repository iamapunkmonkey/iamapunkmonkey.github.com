Some days I wake up and think about what would have happened if I actually took the opportunity to try and go to Clown College. What would my life be like? What would I be doing right now? Would I even be living in Chicago.
  
Some times I wonder if it is too late, am I too old to run away and join the circus. Is that even a responsible thing to do? Maybe I should start working on my juggling again.
